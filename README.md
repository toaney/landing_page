# Brex Travel landing_page

The Brex Travel landing page is an intuitive Single Page Application(SPA) for learning about the travel portal's value proposition and allows visitors to sign up for it by submittign their email address through a form. This app is built with React hooks and pulls content from a server in order to allow dynamic updates through a CMS.

## Installing

To run the project locally, first install project dependencies and node modules. Note that node modules will need to be installed for both the frontend app and backend server. See below for more details.

### Frontend

Install frontend dependencies and node modules by navigating to the project on a terminal and run 'npm install' from the frontend directory.

```
npm install
```

After project dependencies have been installed, run 'npm start' to run the React App. By default, this App will run on http://localhost:3000. 

```
npm start
```

### Server (Backend)

In a separate terminal, navigate to the project and run 'npm install' from the server directory.

```
npm install
```

After backend server dependencies have been installed, run 'npm start' to run the Node server. By default, the server will listen on port 3006. 

```
npm start
```

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you will be able to access the Application from your local browser at http://localhost:3000/.

## Testing

To run unit tests for components, run "npm test" from the frontend directory.

```
npm test
```
